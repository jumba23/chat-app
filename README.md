# About the App
This app was a product of my desire to stay in touch with my family friends around the world. While there are many apps I could use, I wanted to create an app of my own. This app is using socket.io for exchange of data between users. A user can join the app and have other friends join as well. There are also individual theme-related rooms where users can leave their most recent impressions.

Features:

  - A user can choose between light and dark mode.
  - When a user receives a message small notification will come up and remain there until the user selects on the message.
  - Each user will be shown offline if not logged in.


### Sign Up Page 
The Sign Up page provides very simple and straight-forward instructions for new user creation. A picture is mandatory.

### Chat Room Page 
The Chat Room is the center-piece of the app. This is where a user can see available rooms, available friends, and historical presentation of their communication.

# Tools and Technologies 

### ***Client-side (Front-End)***

The front-end of this project is built in React using create-react-app application. For component's state maintenance and communication, REDUX library is used. For API requests I used socket.io-client. React-bootstrap, React-router-bootstrap and CSS are used for styling. React-router-dom is used for routing.

Once a message is captured and sent, socket.io-client will forward the data to back end for further evaluations and communication.

External resources and packages imported for this project are listed below.

### ***Server-side (Back-End)***

The back-end for this site is created using Express.js. For data storage I used two MongoDB and Cloudinary.com. For connection with MongoDB and data model creation I used mongoose.  

This is the point where a message is received and further processed according to associated data that comes with it. Last step is to send the message back to the front end where it should end the journey.

Additional Resources:

   - MongoDB: https://www.mongodb.com/
   - Cloudinary: https://cloudinary.com/

### ***Deployment***

For web deployment I use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). The platform is flexible and easy to use while porviding the simplest path to getting an app to market.
